		<p><strong>Brief Introduction</strong><br><br>Welcome to my blog! If you've ever read <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> by Douglas Hofstadter then you've heard of the phrase strange loops and know how beautifully strange loops describe math and other subjects that math influences - music, art, physics. However, for those that haven't, strange loops hold the key to understanding the patterns we see in everyday life. Learning about the power of these loops has inspired me to write about the patterns that I've noticed in my own life, and thus I've dedicated this blog to the strange loops in life and the boy that bought me the book that exposed me to them, Chase Riley Roberts.<br><br> <strong>Political Unrest, Human Mourning, and Beautifully Tragic Self-Discovery - A 2017 Reflection<br><br>Yesterday, was the last day of 2017, and looking back upon the year, it was a tough year to swallow. The tragedies that touched my world include the mass murder in Las Vegas, Nevada during a country music festival and and the forest fires throughout Sonoma County and surrounding the LA metro area. Friends of mine had just landed at SFO from LAS hours before the shooting and others lost their homes in the fires, while air pollution flooded the region and city of Berkeley. This year also marked the inaguration of president Donald Trump. I remember studying in UC Bekeley's main library, Gardner Main Stacks, while constantly refreshing the state polling numbers the night of the election. I'll never forget what my best friend said to me when defeat finally subbornly settled into our cores. "It's not my life that I'm most worried for." But this is not a political message, it is rather my account of the past year and the trumphs and toils it brought for me and the world. Another close friend of mine, a DACA and California Dream Act recipient, is threatened with deportation given Trump's restrictive immigration policies.<br><br>And while all of this was happening, and much more around the world that I am not even remotely aware of (I admit regrettably), I was learning a lot about myself. Who I want to be? Who I want to be with? What I am good at? What I am not good at? And, less seriously, how to solve a rubix cube? I'm still working on a lot of those. And I hope to share more as I write more posts on this blog. The one comment I will make is that surprises were around every corner, good and bad. Yet, I wouldn't have changed the outcome of any one moment; these moments brought me one step closer to better knowing myself and further becoming a person that turns beliefs into action. This is all I have to say about 2017, but you can bet I will have a lot more to say about 2018.<br></strong><br><strong>Hello 2018! The Age of a New Student, Friend, Daughter, and Thinker</strong><br><br>And here goes it, these are my challenges for 2018, not to be tampered with in any way and to be earned with change, growth, and the positivity and openmindedness towards self-discovery that 2017 helped shape. 1)Think and write before you act, speak, judge, or share 2)Remember sincere appreciation, don't criticize 2)Don't narrow or widen - let things take their course, no path is definitive 3)Know the world you live in and partake in it 4)Work on that book you've always been talking about 5)Life started 20 years ago, don't lose another year 6)Nothing is impossible </p>
