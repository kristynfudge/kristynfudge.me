There is a course at UC Berkeley called CS 98/198-20 - Web Design Decal and I decided to self-study the material presented online in order to make my own website in HTML and CSS. I learned and implemented design techniques such as visual hierarchy, wire framing, image and layouts, and typography and color. I also learned and implemented HTML basics, CSS, and positioning. I intend to build onto my website with jQuery and javaScript in the future. 

The layout of the webpage is as follows: an opening home page called Strange Loopiness, an about me subpage, a blog subpage, and a photography subpage.
